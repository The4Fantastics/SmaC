**SmaCQA Tool**
================
SmaCQA is a textual DSL developed using the Xtext tool incorporated into the Sirius framework. SmaCQA arises due to the limitation of the e3value notation to represent the circumstances in which value exchanges take place between the actors that are part of the model presented in this notation. This limitation makes it difficult to establish a useful technological bridge using MDE to extract, from an e3value model, its corresponding smart contract model. Therefore, the purpose of SmaCQA is to act as support during the model transformation process, supporting the information specified by the user regarding the temporal and economic context for each value exchange between actors.

**Create SmaCQA model**

* Import SmaCly Model (file.xml) generated from SmaC :

  1.Click on the button to import file 

  ![Import XML Model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/SmaCly/Images/SmaCly_import.jpg)

  2.Select the .xml file that contains the model generated by SmaC from a file with the extension .sce

  3.Choose the option "Model" for the root of the SmaCQA model

  4.The application will represent the smart contract model in the form of blocks.

* Generate a HTML view from SmaCQA model:

To export the information collected in the textual question-and-answer model about an e3value value model to HTML format, click on the button in the IDE toolbar shown in next Figure:

![Export to HTML](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/SmaCQA/Images/generatorTable.png)

After this, the environment will generate a file with an HTML extension, which can be viewed by any browser. The file contains a visual representation in the form of a table, as shown in next Figure, with the information collected from the textual question-and-answer model.
