**SmaCQA Tool**
================
SmaCQA is a textual DSL developed with the Xtext tool incorporated in the Sirius framework. SmaCQA arises due to the limitation of the e3value notation to represent the circumstances in which value exchanges take place between the actors that are part of the model presented in this notation. This limitation complicates the establishment of a useful technological bridge using MDE to extract, from an e3value model, its corresponding smart contract model. Therefore, SmaCQA acts as support during the transformation process between models, supporting the information specified by the user about the temporal, economic, etc. context for each value exchange produced between actors.

**Technological bridge between SmaC and SmaCly**

* Import SmaCly Model (file.xml) generated from SmaC :

  1.Click on the button to import file 

  ![Import XML Model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/SmaCly/Images/SmaCly_import.jpg)

  2.Select the .xml file that contains the model generated by SmaC from a file with the extension .sce

  3.Click on the Transform XML to Blockly button

  4.The application will represent the smart contract model in the form of blocks.

**Tips**
________________________
* Language Patterns:

  1.Define file block **(Obligatory).**
  
  2.Define compiler's version block **(Obligatory).**

  2.Define libraries blocks.
  
  3.Define import(s) blocks.
  
  4.Define interface(s) blocks.

  5.Define contracts **(At least 1, Obligatory).**

  6.Define local variable(s).

  7.Define contract's constructor(s).

  8.Define contract's modifier(s).

  9.Define contract's event(s).

  10.Define contract's function(s).

* You have a series of smart contract models represented by blocks that follow standards, such as ERC20, ERC223, etc. To use them, you must select the "Standards" option and select the standard you want:
