 * it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
 * the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
 * transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
 * payment method should be its owner, and provide public methods redirecting 
 * to the escrow's deposit and withdraw.
