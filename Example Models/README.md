### Smart contracts

| Smart contract sce model | Info | Ecore Model
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Array Test](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/ArrayTest.sce) | Solidity program to  demonstrate use assert function | [Array Test model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/ArrayTest.xmi)
| [Access Registration](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/AccessRegistration.sce) | Access Registration | [Access Registration model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/AccessRegistration.xmi)
| [Auction](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/Auction.sce) | Simulate an auction| [Auction model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/Auction.xmi)
| [Penny Auction](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/PennyAuction.sce) | Simulate an penny auction where the bids are restricted to a fixed increment over the current high bid, and there is a fee to bid| [Penny Auction model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/PennyAuction.xmi)
| [Dollar Auction](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/DollarAuction.sce) | A dollar auction requires that the highest and second-highest bidders each pay their bid amounts, although only the highest bidder receives the bid-for prize. (Originally, dollar auctions were so-named because it was a dollar bill that was being auctioned. Their fundamental characteristic, however, is the risk of being the second-highest bidder and getting nothing for your bid.)| [Dollar Auction model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/DollarAuction.xmi)
| [Ballot](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/Ballot.sce) | The idea is to create one contract per ballot, providing a short name for each option. Then the creator of the contract who serves as chairperson will give the right to vote to each address individually. The persons behind the addresses can then choose to either vote themselves or to delegate their vote to a person they trust. At the end of the voting time, winningProposal() will return the proposal with the largest number of votes. | [Ballot model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/Ballot.xmi)
