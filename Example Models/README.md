**Smart contracts coded by SmaC tool**
================
In this directory, a series of smart contracts encoded with the SmaC tool are found as a demonstration.
### Smart contracts

| Title | Info | Ecore Model
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Auction](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/Auction.sce) | Simulate an auction| [Auction model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/Auction.xmi)
| [Penny Auction](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/PennyAuction.sce) | Simulate an penny auction where the bids are restricted to a fixed increment over the current high bid, and there is a fee to bid| [Penny Auction model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/PennyAuction.xmi)
| [Dollar Auction](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/DollarAuction.sce) | A dollar auction requires that the highest and second-highest bidders each pay their bid amounts, although only the highest bidder receives the bid-for prize. (Originally, dollar auctions were so-named because it was a dollar bill that was being auctioned. Their fundamental characteristic, however, is the risk of being the second-highest bidder and getting nothing for your bid.)| [Dollar Auction model](https://github.com/KybeleResearch/SmaC/blob/main/Example%20Models/DollarAuction.xmi)
