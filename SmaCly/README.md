**SmaCly Tool**
================
Technological framework to facilitate the development of smart contracts. SmaCly allows the generation of smart contract models by representing them in the form of graphic blocks. These blocks are generated by Google's Blockly library. In turn, SmaCly allows to import from SmaC models generated by this tool that are readable by SmaCly. This is done by transforming the smart contract model with the .sce extension into a model with the .xml extension readable by SmaCly. The application is in the compressed file named SmaCly.zip, which contains the SmaCly tool as a whole. This tool is made up of a JS folder where the definition of the blocks and the functionality offered by the tool are found. It also consists of an .html file that presents the application so that the user can interact with it.
*SmaCly works offline too, you don't need Internet*

**SmaCly Functionality Guide**
_______________________
* **View the XML of the smart contract model**. The "See Xml" button offers a view of the xml file generated by the application while we define the blocks of our smart contract model.

* **Save the XML of the smart contract model**. The "Save Xml" button offers the possibility of storing the smart contract model (.xml file) represented by blocks on the device on which SmaCly is running.

* **Get a log of app usage activity**. The "Save Log Events" button offers the possibility of storing a record of all the events that have occurred when using SmaCly. **It is necessary** to point out that in order for the events to be registered, the **"Register log events" option must be checked**.

* **Clean workspace**. The "Clean blocks" button provides the ability to remove all graphic blocks from the workspace, having previously confirmed that you want to perform this action.

* **Import file**. The "Choose file" button allows you to select the xml file that contains the information of the model generated by SmaC from a file with the .sce extension.
* **Generate SmaCly blocks representation from XML**. The "Transform XML to Blockly" button It reads the XML information to process it and display the graphic blocks generated from it.

**Technological bridge between SmaC and SmaCly**

* Import SmaCly Model (file.xml) generated from SmaC :

  1.Click on the button to import file

  2.Select the .xml file that contains the model generated by SmaC from a file with the extension .sce

  3.Click on the Transform XML to Blockly button

  4.The application will represent the smart contract model in the form of blocks.

**Tips**
________________________
* Language Patterns:

  1.Define file block **(Obligatory).**
  
  2.Define compiler's version block **(Obligatory).**

  2.Define libraries blocks.
  
  3.Define import(s) blocks.
  
  4.Define interface(s) blocks.

  5.Define contracts **(At least 1, Obligatory).**

  6.Define local variable(s).

  7.Define contract's constructor(s).

  8.Define contract's modifier(s).

  9.Define contract's event(s).

  10.Define contract's function(s).

* You have a series of smart contract models represented by blocks that follow standards, such as ERC20, ERC223, etc. To use them, you must select the "Standards" option and select the standard you want:
